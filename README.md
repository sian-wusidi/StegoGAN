## Abstract
Most image-to-image translation models postulate bijective mapping --- a unique correspondence exists between the semantic classes of the source and target domains. However, this assumption does not always hold in real-world scenarios due to divergent distributions, different class sets, and asymmetrical information representation. 
As conventional GANs attempt to generate images matching the distribution of the target domain, they may hallucinate spurious instances of classes absent from the source domain, thereby diminishing the interpretability and reliability of translated images. 
CycleGAN-based methods are also known to hide the mismatched information in the generated images to bypass cycle consistency objectives, a process known as steganography.
In response to the challenge of non-bijective image translation, we introduce StegoGAN, a novel model that leverages steganography to prevent spurious features in generated images. Our approach enhances the semantic consistency of the translated images without requiring additional postprocessing or supervision. 
Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that StegoGAN outperforms existing GAN-based models across various non-bijective image-to-image translation tasks, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

So, we propose StegoGAN, 
- A model that, instead of disabling steganography, leverages this phenomenon to detect and mitigate semantic misalignment between domains; 
- In settings where the domain mapping is non-bijective, StegoGAN experimentally demonstrates superior semantic consistency over other GAN-based models both visually and quantitatively, without requiring detection or inpainting steps;
- We publish three datasets from open-access sources as a benchmark for evaluating non-bijective image translation models.

## Installation ðŸŒ 

### 1. Create and activate conda environment

```
conda env create -f env_stego_gan.yml
conda activate env_stego_gan
```

### 2. Download datasets

We propose three datasets for benchmarking non-bijective image-to-image translation, and the datasets can be downloaded from Zenodo (To be relased...):

* [PlanIGN] This dataset was constructed from the French National Mapping Agency (IGN), comprising 1900 aerial images (ortho-imagery) at 3m spatial resolution and two versions of their corresponding maps -- one with toponyms and one without toponyms (_TU). We divided them into training (1000 images) and testing (900 images). In our experiment, we use trainA & trainB, testA & testB_TU for training and testing, respectively.
* [Google_mismatch] We created non-bijective datasets from the [map dataset](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix?tab=readme-ov-file) by seperating the samples with highways from those without. We excluded all satellite images (trainA) featuring highways and subsampled maps (trainB) with varying proportions of highways from 0% to 65%. For the test set, we selected 898 pairs without highways. 
* [BRATS_mismatch] We used two modalities from [Brats2018](https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018/data.html) -- T1 and FLAIR. We selected transverse slices from the 60&deg to 100&deg. Each scan was classified as tumorous if more than 1% of its pixels were labelled as such and as healthy if it contained no tumor pixels. We provide "generate_mismatched_datasets.py" so users can generate datasets with varying proportions of tumorous samples during training. In our default seeting, we have 800 training samples with source images (T1) being healthy and target images (FLAIR) comprising 60% tumorous scans. The test set contains 335 paired scans of healthy brains. 

And it should be placed within the 'dataset/' directory.

### 3. Download weights for inference or pre-training

The pre-train weights could be download from:
* [BRATS](To be relased...)
* [IGN](To be relased...)
* [google](To be relased...)

## How to use ðŸš€

### 1. Train models

* For example: training Stego-GAN with Brats dataset (training with pre-trained)
```
python train.py --dataroot dataset/brats/0.6 \
                --name brats_stego_0.6 \
                --model stego_gan \
                --gpu_ids 0 \
                --lambda_reg 0.3 \
                --lambda_consistency 1 \ 
                --resnet_layer 9 \
                --batch_size 12  \
                --no_flip \
                --n_epochs 100
```
Training results and weights are saved at `checkpoints/<name>`.

### 2. Testing models
```
python test.py --dataroot dataset/brats/0.6 \ 
               --name brats_stego_0.6 \ 
               --model stego_gan \
               --phase test \
               --no_dropout \
               --resnet_layer 9
```
Inferencing results will be saved at `results/<model_name>/test_latest`.
